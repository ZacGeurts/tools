# Tools
Personal tools
Consider everything here as WIP.

Do not use these. Never use these.
Might work for you, probably not.
Might eat your computer, probably not.
If you can not read a script leave these alone.

This is not for a games database.
This is for Retroarch thumbnail archival tools.

Use the PS or XBox button or F1 for the menu, or customize in settings.
Scroll lock activates normal keyboard and mouse mode when using emulators with keyboard support.
When adding ROMs, scan your directory first before manual scan.
Change Retroarch default "User Interface - Appearance" from boxarts to title screens for the full showing.
You can also specify thumbnail types on a per playlist basis.

Tools are for Linux and designed to run on MY computer.
Retroarch should be at or above version 1.19.
