Personal tools<BR />
Consider everything here as WIP.<BR />
Tools are for Linux and designed to run on MY computer.<BR />
<BR />
Do not use these. Never use these.<BR />
Might work for you, probably not.<BR />
Might eat your computer, probably not.<BR />
If you can not read a script leave these alone.<BR />

This is not for a games database.<BR />
This is for Retroarch thumbnail archival tools.<BR />
Retroarch should be at or above version 1.19.<BR />
<BR />
shots.sh is the most interesting one and lets you use F8 to instant thumbnail.<BR />
Turn off GPU screenshot so you do not capture any overlays like pause icon.<BR />
Use the PS or XBox button or F1 for the menu, or customize in settings.<BR />
You can screenshot in the menu or just use F8.<BR />
Scroll lock activates normal keyboard and mouse mode when using emulators with keyboard support.<BR />
Hit it again to lose focus and F8 works again.<BR />
When adding ROMs, scan your directory first before manual scan.<BR />
Scanning directory will use the internal DAT for release year etc.<BR />
<BR />
Change Retroarch default "User Interface - Appearance" from boxarts to title screens for the full showing.<BR />
You can also specify thumbnail types on a per playlist basis.<BR />
